- Process: Use 'https://www.onlineconverter.com/compress-mp3' before uploading.

2. NAMING CONVENTION
- Format: [Index].[Description]_[Subtitle]_[Quality].mp3
- Rule: Use UNDERSCORES (_) for spaces you want to see in the app.
- Rule: Use HYPHENS (-) for technical labels (e.g., 4-7hz) you want to keep together.
- Example: "6.pure_theta_4-7hz_piano_compr.mp3" 
  -> Displays as: "Pure Theta 4-7hz Piano"
